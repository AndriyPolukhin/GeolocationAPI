HERE I start making an APP to lookup addressedd based on a post code

Practice: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/geocoding-reverse

1. Create a Front-End
2. get Lat and lon
3. Pass it to the geocoder
4. Use a postCode function: to find postcode and to find address


STEPS:

1. USE Navigator geolocation
2. Create function onSuccess(), onError(), and set parameters for the function
3. Crete function findPostCode() and set the Geocoder in it.
4. Create a function getResults() and use a for loop to find the right type and get it back
