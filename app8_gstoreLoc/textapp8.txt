Simple Store Locator App
Josie's Cafe is a fictitious restaurant chain featuring two different location categories: coffee shops, and patisseries. This tutorial shows you how to build a store locator map application that displays custom markers to indicate store locations. It demonstrates how to do the following things:

Use GeoJSON to define a static list of locations and associated metadata.
Display location markers on a map, using icons to indicate category (cafe or patisserie).
Display location metadata using a custom InfoWindow.
Apply styling to a map.
